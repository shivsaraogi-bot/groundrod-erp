## OPTION 2: Capacitor (RECOMMENDED FOR APP STORES)

**Best for:** Official app store presence, enterprise credibility

### What is Capacitor?
Capacitor (by Ionic) wraps your PWA into native Android and iOS apps. It's the modern, officially supported way to convert web apps to native apps.

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Install Node.js (already have)
# Install Capacitor
npm install -g @capacitor/cli
npm install -g @capacitor/core
```

### Step-by-Step Implementation

#### 1. Initialize Capacitor in Your Project

```bash
cd c:/GroundRodERP
npm init -y  # If not already done
npm install @capacitor/core @capacitor/cli
npx cap init "GroundRod ERP" "com.nikkonferro.groundroderp" --web-dir=public
```

#### 2. Add Android Platform

```bash
npm install @capacitor/android
npx cap add android
```

This creates an `android/` folder with a native Android project.

#### 3. Add iOS Platform (requires Mac)

```bash
npm install @capacitor/ios
npx cap add ios
```

This creates an `ios/` folder with a native Xcode project.

#### 4. Configure App Icons & Splash Screens

Create proper app icons (512x512 PNG minimum):
```bash
# You'll need to create these assets:
# - Icon: 1024x1024 PNG (for both Android and iOS)
# - Splash screen: 2732x2732 PNG
```

Use online tools:
- [App Icon Generator](https://appicon.co/)
- [PWA Asset Generator](https://github.com/elegantapp/pwa-asset-generator)

#### 5. Build and Test

```bash
# Sync web code to native projects
npx cap sync

# Open in Android Studio
npx cap open android

# Open in Xcode (Mac only)
npx cap open ios
```
