# Ground Rod ERP System - Comprehensive Improvements Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes all improvements made to the Ground Rod ERP system to ensure fully integrated workflows with extensive edit capabilities and data consistency.

---

## 🎯 Phase 1: Critical Data Flow Integration

### ✅ 1.1 Production → BOM → Raw Material Consumption
**Location**: `server.js:1965-2080`

**What Changed**:
- Production endpoint now automatically deducts raw materials based on BOM when finished goods are packed
- Transaction-based processing ensures atomic operations
- Automatic audit logging for material consumption

**How It Works**:
```
User logs production (packed quantity) → System checks BOM → Calculates total material needed → Deducts from raw_materials_inventory → Logs audit trail
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Real-time material tracking
- ✅ Accurate cost accounting
- ✅ Prevents negative stock with warnings
- ✅ Transparent audit trail

---

### ✅ 1.2 Inventory Commitment on Client PO
**Location**: `server.js:1203-1255`, Helper function `server.js:244-254`

**What Changed**:
- Added `committed` column to inventory table
- Client PO creation now reserves inventory
- PO deletion uncommits inventory automatically
- Inventory shows: Total, Committed, Available

**How It Works**:
```
Client PO created → Line items added → Each product quantity marked as "committed" in inventory → Available = Packed - Committed
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Prevents double-booking inventory
- ✅ Clear visibility of available vs promised stock
- ✅ Accurate fulfillment planning
- ✅ Automatic reconciliation on PO changes

---

### ✅ 1.3 Shipment → PO Fulfillment Tracking
**Location**: `server.js:1600-1675` (already existed, confirmed working)

**What It Does**:
- Shipment creation updates `delivered` column in `client_po_line_items`
- Inventory deducted from `packed` stage
- Shipment deletion reverses both operations

**How It Works**:
```
Shipment created → Updates PO line item delivered qty → Deducts from inventory.packed → Uncommits inventory → Logs audit
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Real-time fulfillment tracking
- ✅ Prevents over-shipment
- ✅ Accurate inventory balance
- ✅ Complete reversibility

---

## 🛡️ Phase 2: Edit History & Data Integrity

### ✅ 2.1 Audit Trail System
**Location**: `server.js:230-241`, `server.js:547-557`, `server.js:2553-2579`

**What Changed**:
- New `audit_log` table tracks all changes
- Helper function `logAudit()` for easy logging
- API endpoints to view audit history

**Tables Tracked**:
- Client/Vendor Purchase Orders
- Production entries
- Raw material consumption
- Shipments
- Document attachments
- Soft deletes/restores

**API Endpoints**:
- `GET /api/audit-log` - Recent changes (limit 100-500)
- `GET /api/audit-log/:table/:recordId` - Record-specific history

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Complete change history
- ✅ Accountability & traceability
- ✅ Error investigation
- ✅ Compliance & auditing

---

### ✅ 2.2 Soft Deletes & Undo Functionality
**Location**: `server.js:1269-1322`, `server.js:2581-2640`

**What Changed**:
- Added `is_deleted` column to major tables
- Default delete operation is soft delete
- Hard delete available via query param `?hard=true`
- Undo endpoint to restore deleted records

**How It Works**:
```
Delete request → Mark is_deleted=1 → Uncommit inventory (if PO) → Log audit → Return can_undo=true
Undo request → Verify soft-deleted → Mark is_deleted=0 → Recommit inventory → Log restore
```

**API Endpoints**:
- `DELETE /api/purchase-orders/:id` - Soft delete (default)
- `DELETE /api/purchase-orders/:id?hard=true` - Permanent delete
- `POST /api/undo/:table/:recordId` - Restore deleted record

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Accidental deletion recovery
- ✅ Data preservation
- ✅ Automatic inventory reconciliation
- ✅ User-friendly error correction

---

### ✅ 2.3 Validation & Real-time Checks
**Location**: `server.js:2727-2780`

**What Changed**:
- New endpoint to check inventory availability before PO creation
- Returns detailed availability per product
- Shows shortfall warnings

**API Endpoint**:
```json
POST /api/inventory/check-availability
Request: { "line_items": [{ "product_id": "CBG-001", "quantity": 1000 }] }
Response: {
  "available": false,
  "details": [{
    "product_id": "CBG-001",
    "requested": 1000,
    "available": 750,
    "packed": 1500,
    "committed": 750,
    "sufficient": false,
    "shortfall": 250
  }],
  "warnings": ["CBG-001: Need 1000, only 750 available (shortfall: 250)"]
}
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Prevents impossible commitments
- ✅ Proactive planning
- ✅ Clear warning messages
- ✅ User-friendly validation

---

## 📎 Phase 3: Document Management

### ✅ 3.1 Permanent PDF Storage & Retrieval
**Location**: `server.js:2642-2725`

**What Changed**:
- New `document_attachments` table
- Permanent file storage in `/uploads/attachments/{entity_type}/{entity_id}/`
- Files linked to POs, customers, vendors, shipments

**File Organization**:
```
uploads/
└── attachments/
    ├── client_po/
    │   └── PO-001/
    │       ├── 1234567890_invoice.pdf
    │       └── 1234567891_contract.pdf
    ├── vendor_po/
    ├── customer/
    ├── vendor/
    └── shipment/
```

**API Endpoints**:
- `POST /api/attachments/:entityType/:entityId` - Upload file (multipart/form-data)
- `GET /api/attachments/:entityType/:entityId` - List attachments
- `GET /api/attachments/download/:id` - Download specific file
- `DELETE /api/attachments/:id` - Delete attachment

**Supported Entity Types**:
- `client_po`, `vendor_po`, `customer`, `vendor`, `shipment`

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Centralized document storage
- ✅ No file loss on re-import
- ✅ Multiple docs per record
- ✅ Easy retrieval & verification

---

## 🗄️ Phase 4: Database Hardening

### ✅ 4.1 Schema Enhancements
**Location**: `server.js:571-592`

**New Tables**:
1. **audit_log** - Complete change tracking
2. **document_attachments** - File management

**New Columns** (auto-migrated):
- `inventory.committed` - Reserved stock tracking
- `inventory.available` (computed) - Packed - Committed
- `client_purchase_orders.is_deleted` - Soft delete flag
- `vendor_purchase_orders.is_deleted`
- `shipments.is_deleted`
- `production_history.is_deleted`

**Indexes Created**:
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_client_po_status ON client_purchase_orders(status);
CREATE INDEX idx_client_po_customer ON client_purchase_orders(customer_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_vendor_po_vendor ON vendor_purchase_orders(vendor_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_shipment_po ON shipments(po_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_audit_table_record ON audit_log(table_name, record_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_attachments_entity ON document_attachments(entity_type, entity_id);
```

**Foreign Key Enforcement**:
```sql
PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON;
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Query performance improvement
- ✅ Data integrity enforcement
- ✅ Referential consistency
- ✅ Scalability ready

2. **File Upload Validation**: MIME type and size checks
3. **Path Traversal Protection**: Attachments stored in sandboxed directories
4. **Audit Trail**: All destructive operations logged
5. **Soft Deletes**: Prevents accidental data loss

## 📝 Migration Notes

### Automatic Migrations (Already Handled)
The system will automatically:
- Add new columns (`committed`, `is_deleted`) to existing tables
- Create new tables (`audit_log`, `document_attachments`)
- Create indexes for performance
- Enable foreign key constraints

### No Manual Intervention Required
All migrations are handled via:
```javascript
db.all("PRAGMA table_info(inventory)", (err, cols) => {
  if (!cols.includes('committed'))
    db.run("ALTER TABLE inventory ADD COLUMN committed INTEGER DEFAULT 0");
});
```
