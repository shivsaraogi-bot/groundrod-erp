## Troubleshooting

### Issue: List is empty even though I created a PO

**Solution**:
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Check for errors
3. Verify API call: `GET http://localhost:3000/api/client-purchase-orders`
4. Should return JSON array of POs
5. If empty array `[]`, check database

### Issue: "Failed to update delivered quantity"

**Solution**:
1. Verify server is running
2. Check server console for errors
3. Ensure endpoint exists: `PUT /api/client-po-line-items/:itemId/delivered`
4. Check if line item ID is valid

### Issue: Page doesn't scroll after creating PO

**Solution**:
- This is a minor UX issue
- Manually scroll down to see the list
- The PO should still be there

### Issue: Can't see "View Details" button

**Solution**:
- Scroll the table horizontally
- "View Details" is in the rightmost "Actions" column
- Make browser window wider if needed

---

## Database Verification (Advanced)

If you want to verify data in the database directly:

```bash
# Install SQLite browser (optional)
# Or use command line:

sqlite3 erp_database.db "SELECT * FROM client_purchase_orders;"
sqlite3 erp_database.db "SELECT * FROM client_po_line_items;"
```

Check for:
- `client_purchase_orders` table has your PO
- `client_po_line_items` table has line items
- `delivered` column has correct values

---

## Screenshot Checklist

Take screenshots of:
1. ✅ Empty list before creating PO
2. ✅ Filled form ready to submit
3. ✅ List showing new PO after creation
4. ✅ Expanded "View Details" showing line items
5. ✅ Edit mode for delivered quantity
6. ✅ Updated delivered and remaining values
7. ✅ Complete fulfillment (Remaining = 0)

---
