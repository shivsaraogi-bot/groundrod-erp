# Ground Rod ERP - Future Enhancement Ideas

## üìã Deferred for Later Implementation

### Product Costing Module
**Status:** Deferred - Too complex for current stage
**What it would include:**
- Calculate total product cost = material cost + job work charges + overhead allocation
- Track cost per finished unit in inventory
- Show cost vs. selling price margin on Customer POs
- Dashboard showing most/least profitable products

**Prerequisites:**
- Need 3-6 months of actual production data
- Need to stabilize overhead allocation methodology
- Requires Job Work Cost Tracking (planned for current phase)

---

### Material Consumption Variance Tracking
**Status:** ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED (v28.0)
**Implementation details:**
- BOM defines expected consumption per unit
- Production history tracks quantities produced
- System automatically calculates: Expected (from BOM) vs Actual (from audit logs)
- No additional user input required!

**Features implemented:**
- Audit log analysis for CONSUMED actions (last 30 days)
- Automatic variance calculation: (Actual - Expected) / Expected √ó 100
- Highlights variances >5% as HIGH_VARIANCE
- Dashboard showing all variances sorted by percentage
- Summary cards: Total variances, high variance count, average variance %

---

### Quality Control Enhanced Tracking
**Status:** Requires moderate factory input
**What would be needed:**
- QC inspection form with rejection reasons (dropdown: plating defect, dimension issue, surface defect, etc.)
- Photo upload capability for defects
- Inspector name/timestamp (already have this via audit)
- Rework tracking (can rejected items be fixed?)

**User burden:** ~2-3 minutes per QC batch inspection
**Value:** High if you have quality issues; Medium if quality is already good

---

### Batch/Lot Traceability
**Status:** Requires significant data model changes
**Complexity:** High
**Prerequisites:** Stable production process, customer requirement for traceability

---

### Multi-Currency Support Enhancement
**Status:** Basic currency support exists; full support is low priority
**Current state:** System has currency field in POs and invoices
**Enhancement would add:** Exchange rate management, forex gain/loss, multi-currency reporting

---

### Automated Email Notifications
**Status:** Good candidate for later implementation
**Prerequisites:** Need email server configuration (SMTP)
**Modules to notify:**
- Low stock alerts ‚Üí purchasing team
- Customer PO confirmation ‚Üí customer contacts (we have multiple contacts feature now!)
- Production completion ‚Üí sales team
- Invoice reminders ‚Üí customer accounts team
- Vendor PO delivery reminders ‚Üí vendor contacts

**Implementation complexity:** Medium (need email service, templates, scheduling)

---

### Vendor Performance Scorecard
**Status:** Good addition after 6 months of data
**What to track:**
- On-time delivery rate
- Quality rejection rate (for job work)
- Price competitiveness (compare vendors for same material/service)
- Reliability score
**Prerequisites:** Need historical data to calculate meaningful metrics

---

### Cash Flow Forecasting
**Status:** Useful after invoice/payment tracking is mature
**What it provides:**
- Accounts receivable aging (who owes money, how old)
- Accounts payable (what you owe to vendors)
- Projected cash in/out by week
- Working capital requirements

**Current gap:** System tracks invoices but limited payment tracking

---

### Inventory Aging Analysis
**Status:** Can implement after current phase
**Complexity:** Low-Medium
**What it shows:**
- Age of inventory in each stage (cores, plated, stamped)
- Products with slow-moving stock (>90 days)
- Inventory carrying cost calculation
**Prerequisites:** Need to track entry_date for inventory items (currently only track updated_at)
