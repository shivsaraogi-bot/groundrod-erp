## 📊 Sample Data Flow

### **Scenario: Complete Order Fulfillment**

```
1. RECEIVE MATERIALS FROM VENDOR
   ↓
2. LOG PRODUCTION (100 rods packed)
   → System auto-deducts 350kg steel, 25kg copper (BOM-based)
   → Inventory.packed = 100
   ↓
3. CREATE CLIENT PO (50 rods)
   → System commits 50 units
   → Packed: 100, Committed: 50, Available: 50
   ↓
4. CREATE SHIPMENT (50 rods)
   → PO delivered qty updated to 50
   → Packed: 50, Committed: 0, Available: 50
   ↓
5. VIEW AUDIT LOG
   → See complete history of all operations
```
