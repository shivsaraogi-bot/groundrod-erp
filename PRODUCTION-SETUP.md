## 🎯 How to Use the System

### 1. **Adding Data via CSV Import**

Download these sample CSV files from your local folder:
- `c:\GroundRodERP\public\test-data-vendors.csv`
- `c:\GroundRodERP\public\test-data-customers.csv`
- `c:\GroundRodERP\public\test-data-products.csv`

Then on your Render site:
1. Go to **Vendors tab** → Click "Choose CSV File" → Upload vendors CSV
2. Go to **Customers tab** → Click "Choose CSV File" → Upload customers CSV
3. Go to **Products tab** → Click "Choose CSV File" → Upload products CSV (BOMs auto-generate!)

### 2. **Adding Data Manually**

Just use the forms in each tab - all data is **automatically saved to Render's persistent disk**.

---

## 💾 Database Persistence

**Your data is now permanently stored on Render** in `/var/data/groundrod.db`

- ✅ Survives deployments
- ✅ Survives server restarts
- ✅ Never gets wiped
- ✅ Backed up by Render

**You can now work, close the browser, and come back later - all your data will be there!**

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### If you see 502 errors:
- Render free tier spins down after 15 min of inactivity
- Wait 30-60 seconds and refresh - server will restart automatically

### If data seems missing:
- Check you're on the right Render URL
- Make sure Render deployment finished (check dashboard)
- CSV import shows success message after upload

### Need to start fresh:
- Just delete entries manually from the UI
- Or re-upload CSV files (they replace existing data with same IDs)
