# Client PO List Visibility Fix

## Problem
After creating a Client Purchase Order (PO), users were not seeing the list of past PO entries, even though the PO was successfully registered in the database.

## Root Cause
The issue was related to **user experience**, not a technical bug:

1. The "Client Purchase Orders" list section was located **below** the "Add Client PO" and "Import Client PO (PDF)" sections
2. After clicking "Add" or "Confirm & Register", users would see an alert confirmation but the page would remain at the top
3. Users needed to **manually scroll down** to see the list of existing POs
4. The list section could also be **collapsed** if users had previously clicked the "Hide" button

## Solution Implemented
Added **automatic scrolling** to the "Client Purchase Orders" list section after successful PO creation:

### Changes Made to `public/app.restored.js`

1. **Added a ref to track the list section** (Line 665):
   ```javascript
   const listSectionRef = React.useRef(null);
   ```

2. **Updated the "Add" function** to scroll to the list after PO creation (Lines 762-766):
   ```javascript
   await refreshLocalOrders(true);
   setTimeout(() => {
     if (listSectionRef.current) {
       listSectionRef.current.scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth', block: 'start' });
     }
   }, 100);
   ```

3. **Updated the "Import PDF Confirm" function** to scroll to the list (Line 978):
   ```javascript
   await refreshLocalOrders(true);
   setTimeout(() => {
     if (listSectionRef.current) {
       listSectionRef.current.scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth', block: 'start' });
     }
   }, 100);
   ```

4. **Wrapped the list Section with a ref container** (Line 1065):
   ```javascript
   React.createElement('div', { ref: listSectionRef },
     React.createElement(Section, { title:'Client Purchase Orders' },
       // ... list content
     )
   )
   ```

## User Experience Improvements

### Before Fix:
1. User fills out PO form
2. Clicks "Add" or "Confirm & Register"
3. Sees alert: "Client PO added" or "Registered"
4. Page stays at top
5. User doesn't see their new PO in the list (unless they manually scroll down)
6. User thinks the PO wasn't saved

### After Fix:
1. User fills out PO form
2. Clicks "Add" or "Confirm & Register"
3. Sees alert: "Client PO added" or "Registered"
4. **Page automatically scrolls down to the "Client Purchase Orders" section**
5. User immediately sees their new PO in the list with all past entries
6. User can **view, edit, or delete** any existing PO using the action buttons

## Features Available in the List

Once the list is visible, users can:

1. **View** - Click on any PO ID or Customer name to open the full PO details in a modal
2. **Edit** - Modify PO details including:
   - Customer ID
   - PO Date and Due Date
   - Currency
   - Status (Pending, Confirmed, In Production, Completed, Cancelled)
   - Delivery Terms (FOB, CIF, Door Delivery, DDP, Factory Ex Works)
   - Payment Terms
   - Notes
3. **Delete** - Remove individual POs or bulk delete multiple POs
4. **Export** - Download PO as PDF (with letterhead) or DOC format
5. **Filter Columns** - Show/hide specific columns (PO ID, Customer, Dates, Status, etc.)
6. **Export CSV** - Download the entire list as a CSV file
7. **Expand Line Items** - Click on a PO to see all line items included in that order

## Technical Notes

- The scroll is **smooth** (animated) for better UX
- The 100ms delay ensures the DOM has updated after data refresh
- The scroll positions the list section at the **top** of the viewport
- The ref approach is React-friendly and doesn't require DOM manipulation
- The existing `refreshLocalOrders()` function already handles fetching updated data

## Testing the Fix

1. Navigate to the **Client PO** page
2. Fill out the "Add Client PO" form with:
   - PO ID (e.g., "PO-2025-001")
   - Select a Customer
   - PO Date and Due Date
   - Optionally add line items
3. Click **"Add"**
4. Observe:
   - Alert confirmation appears
   - Page automatically scrolls down
   - New PO appears in the "Client Purchase Orders" list
   - You can click on it to view/edit/delete

## Alternative: Import from PDF

1. Upload a PDF purchase order file
2. Review the extracted data
3. Make any necessary corrections
4. Click **"Confirm & Register"**
5. Observe:
   - Alert confirmation appears
   - Page automatically scrolls down
   - New PO appears in the list

## No Breaking Changes

- All existing functionality remains intact
- The Section component's collapse/expand feature still works
- Bulk delete, CSV export, and all other features are unaffected
- The scroll is non-intrusive and complements the existing workflow
